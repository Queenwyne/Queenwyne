- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first-ever programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace? She collaborated with Charles Babbage on his mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, and wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Ada Lovelace's contributions to computing make her a pioneer in the field and an inspiration to aspiring programmers everywhere!
